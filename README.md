Borrowing digital currency against real world assets within decentralised finance

Abstract:
After the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged as the foundation for a new era of peer-to-peer transactions. Its underlying technology, the blockchain, allows for the issuance and movement of digital assets without a central authority. This new technology spurred the innovation behind a new, unbiased and open financial system. This decentralised financial system has the ability to remove the restrictive power of central authorities and empower participants to gain control of their finances. 
The goal of this project will be to explore decentralised finance by implementing a system to enable the use of real world assets on the Ethereum blockchain. This work follows a novel approach to representing real world assets as non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, it explores the use of these tokenised real world assets as collateral which enables users to borrow a stable cryptocurrency. This will entail designing and creating a system to integrate with an existing lending protocol.
